ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Plugin Practice Roadmap

  1. HtmlWebpackPlugin (must-have in every project)
      Auto-generates an index.html in dist/.
      Injects <script src="bundle.js"> automatically.
      ðŸ‘‰ First plugin weâ€™ll practice.
  
  
  2. CleanWebpackPlugin
      Cleans the dist/ folder before every new build.
      Prevents old files from piling up.
  
  3. DefinePlugin
      Injects environment variables into your app.
      ðŸ‘‰ Example: process.env.NODE_ENV.
  
  4. MiniCssExtractPlugin
      Extracts CSS into separate files (instead of keeping it inside JS).
      Industry standard for production.
  
  5. HotModuleReplacementPlugin
      Enables hot reloading during development.
      No full page reload, only updates changed modules.
  
  6. TerserWebpackPlugin
      Minifies and optimizes JS (production builds).
  
  7. OptimizeCssAssetsPlugin / css-minimizer-webpack-plugin
      Minifies CSS.
  
  8. BundleAnalyzerPlugin
      Visual report of your bundle size.
      ðŸ‘‰ Helps optimize performance.
  
  âœ… With these, youâ€™ll cover all major plugins used in industry.
  âœ… We can also touch some advanced ones (copy assets, service workers, etc.), but the above are the core must-knows.
